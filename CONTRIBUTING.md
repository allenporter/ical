setting up a development environment.

## Setup a virtual environment

```
$ script/setup
```

## Running the tests

From within your virtual environment:

```
$ script/test
```

## Running pre-commit

Before sending a PR ensure the formatting is correct:

```

```

## Contributing

Committing the change will run all necessary formatting, type checking, and
linting. Prefer small PRs to make reviews easy to manage.
