# Unsupported

This captures known parts of rfc5545 that are currently missing, mostly as a
TODO tracker so they are not forgotten. This is not meant to be fully exhaustive.

- Testing example (e.g. using shared fixtures)
- Reduce visibility of internal parsers (e.g. contentlines)
- Unknown components (fix extra field parsing)
- Accessing non-formatting property parameters
- Serializing extra properties
- Encoded timezones e.g.
        - DTSTART;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20220802T090000
        - DTEND;TZID=America/Los_Angeles:20220802T093000
        + DTSTART:20220802T090000Z
        + DTEND:20220802T093000Z
- Repeated property serialization e.g. 'resources.yaml'. Multi-line vs repeated, and preserving property parameters
- Recurrence
  - Verify start date format is the same as the event
  - Verify daylight saving time in until and start is the same
- Recurrence timezone formattings
- Recurrence datetime field encoded properly
- Ignore and preserve unsupported Recurrence rules
- Quoting/Dequoting in property parameters
