This captures known parts of rfc5545 that are currently missing, mostly as a
TODO tracker so they are not forgotten. This is not meant to be fully exhaustive.

- Ignore and preserve x-comp and iana-comp values unrecognized
- Complete todo properties
- Complete vevent properties
- Reduce visibility of internal parsers (e.g. contentlines)
- Encoding escaped characters in properties
