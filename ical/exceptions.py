    When validating a ParsedProperty, it may not be known what data-type

    from "this property should be this data-type, but it is invalid". The
    former should raise a ValueError and the latter ParameterValueError.
    The motivating example is "DTSTART;TZID=GMT:20250601T171819" as either
    datetime or date. It fails to be a datetime because of an unrecognized
    timezone, and fails to be a date, because it is a datetime. Rather
